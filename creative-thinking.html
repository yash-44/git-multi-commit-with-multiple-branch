        <p>Active listening involves listening with all senses.  
            As well as giving full attention to the speaker, 
            it is important that the ‘active listener’ is also 
            ‘seen’ to be listening - otherwise the speaker may conclude that 
            what they are talking about is uninteresting to the listener.</p>
