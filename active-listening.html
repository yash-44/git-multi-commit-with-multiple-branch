        <h1>Active-Listening skills</h1>
        <p>'Active listening' means, as its name suggests,actively listening.
            That is fully concentrating on what is being said rather than just 
            passively ‘hearing’ the message of he speaker.</p>
        <p>Active listening involves listening with all senses. 
           As well as giving full attention to the speaker, 
           it is important that the ‘active listener’ is also ‘seen’ to 
           be listening - otherwise the speaker may conclude that 
           what they are talking about is uninteresting to the listener.</p>
