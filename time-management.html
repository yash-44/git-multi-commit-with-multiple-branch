        <h1>Time-Management skills</h1>
        <p>Time management is the process of organizing and planning how to divide your time between different activities. 
            Get it right, and you'll end up working smarter, not harder, to get more done in less time â€“ even when time is tight 
            and pressures are high.</p>
